			<p class="body-text">You know what that means. The lunch rush will commence and it will be a war zone in the breakroom. I’m just a standard 800 watt sunbeam tabletop microwave (sleek silver edition - at least I’ve got that going for me), you can call me Sunny. I make my home in a standard office building, just doing my job like everybody else. </p>

			<p class="body-text">Here comes Helen with another one of her casseroles. The smell alone is enough to make an elephant faint. To top it off-she never cleans up after herself. It’s always fettuccini sauce on Monday’s and brown gravy on Thursdays. Unplug me now.</p>

		<p class="body-text"> Great...Here comes Angela. She struts in here with her Lean Cuisine box “only 250 calories per serving! No trans-fat” thinking she’s all healthy and better than everyone. Between you and me (well, and Angela’s bowels) that ain’t no lean cuisine. I don’t know how she pulls it off, but she stuffs two Hungry Man meatloaf deluxe meals in there and puts it back no problem.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Right on time, it’s 3:30PM and here comes Jeff with his Orville Redinbocker movie theatre butter popcorn (you really can taste the difference). I don’t know how he’s still alive, I haven’t seen him eat anything else in the six years that I’ve been in service. The guy only weighs 98lbs but he eats that in popcorn each week.</p>
